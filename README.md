This script implements CellProfiler's object identification and feature extraction capabilities with the features being output to a spreadsheet. The script can be ran using:
```
python feature_extract.py /path_to_mask_image/mask.jpg
```
The functions "meansure_texture" and "measure_object_intensity_distribution" still need to be implemented as well as the standard deviation insensity in "measure_object_intensisty"
